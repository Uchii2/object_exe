# ColorGame

Second Java Game project.
The goal of this solo or multiplayer game is to cover the board with only one color.
The player starts frome the firts square in top-left. 
In a minimum number of color change, the player can expend the color on the board.

In the multiplayer mode, up to 4 players can fight against each other in order to cover the board with one color first. 
Each player starts on a different case(top-bottom, top-right and bottom-left)

There is also three levels of difficulty that change the size and the number of cases in the board. 
The number of possible color changes upgrade with the difficulty.
